Java Isometric Graphics System Awesome Wow: My high school attempt to make a 3D engine in Java2D

## This thing is really bad. I wrote it in 2006 when I was 17 and before I knew things.

I wanted to see if I could make a 3D effect by applying things I learned in pre-calculus with a 2D engine.
I sort of succeeded...  don't look at the source, though.

## To run it

I don't even know if it'll compile on new java. These .class files are from 2006.

You need a java runtime installed, and `java` to be on your path. On a mac, you can `brew cask install java`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mturley/JIGSAW-legacy.git
cd JIGSAW-legacy
java JIGSandbox
```
